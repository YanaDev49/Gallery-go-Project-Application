 **Gallery go!** is an aesthetic and interactive web application where every visit earns you points! I built this as a way to integrate my keen eye for design with some docker principles I've been learning: **Flask**, **Redis**, and **Docker Compose**. This web application is simple, but with dynamic backgrounds and a live leaderboard, which is an engaging way to track visits and make the experience more visual. Hope you enjoy exploring it!

## Features 🎮

### - **Earn Points**: Every time you visit or hit the **‘Earn Points’ button**, you collect points. After accessing the web page for the first time, you can earn points by simply restarting the page!

### - **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Each refresh or point earned gives you a new background from the world's most stunning galleries. This adds the aesthetic element of the appllication that i was going for!

### - **Gamified Experience**: Just a fun, interactive way to make visiting the site more engaging! i wanted to add an additional feature of gamification to my application to engage users and encourage participation.
